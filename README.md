# What is ClojureDart?

ClojureDart is a port of the Clojure language to Dart.

Its primary goal is to leverage Dart and Flutter to extend Clojure's reach to
mobile and desktop apps.

# Confidentiality

In our opinion ClojureDart isn't ready for the limelight yet but can still be
useful. This is why it is in a state of **private preview** and not general
availability (we value quality feedback from a small group).

As such **don't share it**. Thanks!

# Status

Here be Dragons!

ClojureDart is a work-in-progress. Some features may be outright missing or
partially implemented or even bugged. In any case get in touch with us or open
an issue.

- no REPL yet
- multi-method (WIP)
- sorted-collection (WIP)


Some differences have been documented, see [Differences with Clojure](doc/differences.md).

# Quick starts

- [Plain Dart](doc/quick-start.md) (recommended first step)
